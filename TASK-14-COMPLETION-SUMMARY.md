  - Admin workflow with internal notes and public responses
  - Permission and security controls throughout the process
  - Error handling scenarios (email failures, database errors)
  - Multi-user access control validation

### ‚úÖ **3. Component Tests for Main React Components**

**React Component Tests:**

- `src/app/components/support/SupportTicketForm.test.tsx` - Form validation, submission, loading states, error handling
- `src/app/components/support/UserTicketsList.test.tsx` - Ticket display, interactions, empty states, accessibility
- `src/app/components/admin/TicketsTable.test.tsx` - Admin functionality, filtering, sorting, pagination

### ‚úÖ **4. Mobile Responsiveness and Accessibility Compliance**

**Accessibility Testing:**

- `src/test/accessibility/support-accessibility.test.tsx` - Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 compliance testing:
  - Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA attributes
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Focus management and visual indicators
  - Color contrast validation
  - Semantic HTML structure
  - Form accessibility with proper labels and error announcements

**Mobile Responsiveness Testing:**

- `src/test/responsive/support-responsive.test.tsx` - Mobile-first design validation:
  - Touch-friendly interface elements (44px minimum touch targets)
  - Responsive layout adaptations for different screen sizes
  - Mobile form interactions and input handling
  - Viewport-specific behaviors and breakpoints
  - Performance optimizations for mobile devices

### ‚úÖ **5. Final Integration into Main Application**

**Test Infrastructure Setup:**

- `vitest.config.ts` - Comprehensive test configuration with coverage reporting
- `src/test/setup.ts` - Global test setup, mocks, and environment configuration
- `src/test/utils.tsx` - Test utilities, mock data generators, and custom render functions
- `src/test/db-utils.ts` - Database testing utilities with MongoDB Memory Server
- `package.json` - Updated with all necessary testing dependencies and scripts

**Build System Integration:**

- Fixed PostCSS configuration for Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility
- Resolved build errors and ensured development server functionality
- Integrated testing with existing build pipeline
